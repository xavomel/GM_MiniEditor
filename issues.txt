issue 1
in blairwisp, sliders don't work quite right for mortal 4, 
there might be some script that causes his insanity to never go below willpower
(it can be set above however)

issue 2
handyman has only 1 set of addresses despite being present in 2 scenarios (calamityville horror and poultrygeist),
any changes made to this mortal will affect both scenarios
