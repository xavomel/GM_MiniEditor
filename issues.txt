###
issue 1
in blairwisp, sliders don't work quite right for mortal 4, 
there might be some script that causes his insanity to never go below willpower
(it can be set above however)
###

###
issue 2
handyman has only 1 set of addresses despite being present in 2 scenarios (calamityville horror and poultrygeist),
any changes made to this mortal will affect both scenarios
###

###
issue 3
in ghostbreakers, changing Windwalker's powers or trying to bind him somewhere else will cause the game to crash,
most likely because he was not meant to be used in that scenario and was left incomplete 
(he becomes interactable after enabling Responsive Empty Portraits)

SOLUTION:
enable Bench Restless Ghosts, bench Windwalker, wait a bit then bind him
